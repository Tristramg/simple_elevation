simple_elevation
================

Python library to get the elevation of some point on earth and elevation profiles.

The data is downloaded from the NASA server www2.jpl.nasa.gov/srtm/ and kept in cache. So the first request will need some time.
The next one will be significantly faster.
Each download is a tile that covers a 1 degree wide surface.

One anoying thing is that the tiles are separated in different folders. This is why you have to specify the regions by hand.
The regions are: "Africa", "Australia", "Eurasia", "Islands", "North_America" and "South_America".

How to use this library: three files with three different services.

elevation.py
------------

Gets you the elevation of some point on earth :

    import elevation
    el = elevation.ElevationData('Eurasia')
    print el.altitude(lon=2.4, lat=48.86)

profile.py
----------

Gets you an elevation profile between two points :

    from profile import steps
    print steps(2.4, 48.86, 2.41, 48.82, 'Eurasia')

The default resolution is 1200 points per degree. Try not to ask more than one degree. You can, but Iâ€™m not responsible.

webservice.py
-------------

Braindead webservice that could be handy if you want to display elevation data on a map (but it supports jsonp).

    python webservice.py &
    curl "http://localhost:8080/profile?lon1=2.4&lat1=48.86&lon2=2.41&lat2=48.82"
